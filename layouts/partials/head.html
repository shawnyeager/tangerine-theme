{{/*
Purpose: Main HTML <head> element with all meta tags, links, and scripts

This partial has been refactored into focused sub-partials for better maintainability:
- head/meta-tags.html - Basic meta tags (charset, viewport, description, canonical, robots)
- head/resources.html - CSS, fonts, RSS, sitemap, favicons
- head/analytics.html - Plausible analytics setup and 404 tracking
- head/social-cards.html - Open Graph and Twitter Card tags
- head/theme-init.html - Dark mode initialization script (prevents FOUC)

Structured data is handled by a single dispatcher:
- structured-data-dispatch.html - Routes to appropriate schema partials based on page context

Parameters: None (uses page and site context)
