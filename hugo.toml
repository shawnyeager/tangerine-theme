# Hugo Configuration for Tangerine Theme
# Shared params for all sites using this theme
#
# NOTE: Hugo only merges [params] and [[menu.*]] from theme modules
# Top-level config (markup, imaging, taxonomies, etc.) must be in site configs
# Sites automatically inherit these params via Hugo's module merge system
# Site-specific hugo.toml files override these defaults as needed
